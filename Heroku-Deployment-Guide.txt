-     1- requirements.txt: details of python env, find using "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
-     2- Procfile: Tells Heroku what web server to use to run your application
-               Add the line: "web:gunicorn script:app" here, script is our python code (script.py) and app is the name of the variable holding the flask instance (Procfile and the script should be in the same folder)
-     3- runtime.txt: python version that you want heroku to run your app with. (if not specified, it will run with some default version, currently 2.7)
-                     add the line "python-3.6.0"
- Open your computer terminal/command line to point to the directory where the Python file containing your app code is located.
- Using the terminal, log in to Heroku with "heroku login"
- Enter your Heroku email address
- Enter your Heroku password
- Create a new Heroku app with "heroku create <app_name>"
- Initialize a local git repository with "git init"
- Add your local application files to git with "git add ."
- Tell git your email address with "git config --global user.email "<email_id>"". Make sure the email address is inside quotes here.
- Tell git your username (just pick whatever username) with "config --global user.name "<username>"". The username should be in quotes.
- Commit the changes with "git commit -m "first commit"". Make sure "first commit" is inside quotes.
- Before pushing the changes to Heroku, tell heroku the name of the app you want to use with heroku "git:remote --app <app_name>"
- Push the changes to Heroku with "git push heroku master"
- That should do it. Go ahead and open your app with "heroku open".
